**Figure 1. Alpha diversity across 10 PRJEB25642 samples.** Left: Observed ASV richness; Right: Shannon diversity index. Samples with higher Shannon indicate greater richness and evenness.

**Figure 2. PCoA (Brayâ€“Curtis) of gut microbiome composition.** Samples closer together share more similar communities; separation along axes indicates compositional differences.

**Figure 3. Relative abundance at the Phylum level.** Bacteroidota and Firmicutes are prevalent across samples, with Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota contributing in subsets.
